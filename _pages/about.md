I’m a Ph.D. student in Human-Centered Computing at Georgia Tech advised by [Dr. Jessica Roberts] (https://jessicaannroberts.com/) in [Tiles Lab] (https://tiles.cc.gatech.edu/), where my research focuses on promoting data literacy through data visualization in informal learning environments. I design interactive systems and learning experiences to empower middle school students and public audiences to actively engage with and communicate using data.

My work brings together insights from learning sciences, data visualization, and human-computer interaction. I collaborate closely with visualization researchers, K–12 educators, and K-12 students to design and evaluate both educational tools and pedagogical frameworks. Ultimately, I aim to make data more accessible, relatable, and powerful for learners and the general public by leveraging visualization as a tool for both inquiry and communication.
